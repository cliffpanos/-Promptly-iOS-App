# Promptly-iOS-App
"Promptly" is an iOS Application created using Swift that aids presenters by giving them timed vibration alerts via iPhone &amp; Apple Watch

Presenters setup a presentation that they plan to give with a title and duration, and they can then choose which intervals or "checkpoints" at which they want to receive presentation alerts. These alerts are simple timed vibrations that should let the presenter know when he has 10, 5, and then 1 minute remaining, for example.
